# OLYMPUS System Architecture

## Overview

Project OLYMPUS implements a sophisticated multi-layered architecture designed for safe, ethical, and intelligent autonomous operations. The system follows a modular design with strict separation of concerns, comprehensive safety validation, and ethical oversight at every level.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Safety-First Design**
- Every component validates actions through the ethical framework
- Multi-layer safety filtering prevents harmful operations
- Emergency shutdown capabilities at all levels
- Human override authority is absolute and immediate

### 2. **Modular Architecture**
- Loosely coupled components with well-defined interfaces
- Plugin-based extension system for new capabilities
- Independent module testing and validation
- Graceful degradation when components fail

### 3. **Transparency & Auditability**
- Complete audit trails for all operations
- Explainable decision-making processes
- Real-time monitoring and logging
- Human-readable system status and diagnostics

## System Layers
